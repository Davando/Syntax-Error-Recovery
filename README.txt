For my project, Iâ€™ve implemented all the necessary requirements, such as
translating the provided C code in C++, extending the language with if and do/check statements as well as the rest of the extended grammar, recovery from lexical errors, implementing the parser error recovery mechanism (Wirth method), and outputting the syntax tree. 

HOW TO COMPILE:
	1) type make 
	2) type ./parse
	2) type in test cases as needed
